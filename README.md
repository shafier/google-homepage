From the Odin Project on HTML and CSS https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/html-css.<br/>
The objective of the HTML / CSS project is to build a website that mimics [www.google.com](https://www.google.com/).<br/>
<br/>
The aims are:<br/> 
* To use HTML and CSS codes which were learnt from the Odin Project.
* This includes but **NOT limited** to using TAG e.g. ```<"p></p>``` and CLASS selector e.g. ```.Iamclass {}```.
* To move up the code from my laptop to GitHub website and move down (copying from Respository).

This is my **first time** creating a webpage from scratch! <br/>
