From the Odin Project on HTML and CSS https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/html-css.
The HTML / CSS project is to build a website that mimics www.google.com.
To use HTML and CSS codes which were learnt from the Odin Project.
This includes but NOT limited to using TAG e.g. "<p></p>" and CLASS selector e.g. ".p {}".
To move up the code from my laptop to GitHub website and move down (copying from Respository).
