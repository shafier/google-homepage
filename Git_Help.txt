How to contribute to an OPEN source code using Git and GitHub.

Refer to the instructions in the The Odin Project:

https://github.com/TheOdinProject/curriculum/blob/master/contributing.md

Note:

I did this for the first time for the HTML / CSS project EASY part in the Odin Project.

This involves: 

Fork -> Clone -> Push -> Pull (Pull Request).

Fork basically means copy. 

for more info, refer to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mENDYhfxH-o.

some commands:
git clone git@github.com:shafier/the_repo
-> the_repo = name of the forked repo

git remote add upstream git@github.com:TheOdinProject/curriculum.git
-> to add a second remote linking to the Original Remote Repo
-> easy method is to copy the SSH link
-> upstream is the convention name

git remote -v

git add -A
git commit -m ""

git pull upstream master
-> to compare and merge IF there is a NEW change in the Original Remote Repo 
vs my copy in my local computer

git pull = git fetch AND git merge


DONE.
